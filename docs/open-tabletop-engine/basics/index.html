    <main>
        <p>This document defines the basic framework and definitions for the rest of the ruleset, which defines spells, mechanics, and more. This is more of a framework that the rest is built on. The other parts can be modified much more easily, but modifying this may break things as it is foundational.</p>
<p>All of the systems provided by Open Tabletop Engine, while interacting in many ways, can be replaced with your own systems fairly easily. Don't like the potion system? Make your own! Magic system dosen't fit in your world? Make or find one that does!</p>
<h2>Dice</h2>
<p>Dice will be defined as <code>d&lt;sides&gt;</code> in this document.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Dice</th>
<th>Role</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>d20</td>
<td>Skill checks, most everything. If in doubt: This is what you probably want</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d12</td>
<td>Heavy weapons damage, mostly. Often used to generate times of day, or simillar things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d10</td>
<td>Percentile dice, can be used to get a number between 1 and 10 or 1 and 100.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d6</td>
<td>Commonly used for healing and health related actions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>d4</td>
<td>Aside from being worse to step on than a lego piece, is often used for very light weapons or potion effects.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Calculating Values</h2>
<p>Negative values are instead set to 0. So for example, a creature that deals 1d4-3 damage has an attack array of [0, 0, 0, 1] making it a very low threat.</p>
<p>With damage and ranges, if attacking closer than the specified minimum, damage is lowered by 1d4 for every tile closer than the minimum. You can attempt to atack farther aswell if using a ranged or magic weapon, but damage is also reduced by 1dN for every tile beyond its range where N is the number of tiles you are attemping to attack past, rounding up.</p>
<p>For example, attempting to shoot a bow 2 tiles past its maximum range will reduce its damage by 2d4, and attempting to shoot it 5 tiles past its max range will reduce its damage by 5d6.</p>
<p>With damage, random citcical hits are not a thing unless specified.</p>
<h2>Item Rarity</h2>
<p>The following table has a list of all raritys you are the main tier system. All open for change, in both name color and description.</p>
